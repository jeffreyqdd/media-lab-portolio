# This task is slightly different than the others.
# The user _gammaobstacle_ is running a guessing game on this machine; your goal is to win the game!
# However, you are not expected to simply guess the secret word - this would be an impractical game to win.
#
# There is a flaw in the code to the game that you can exploit, to get it to TELL YOU THE SECRET!
#
# The `server.c` and `server.h` files are the source code for the game - they have been annotated
# to highlight the portions of code merely used to implement the network communication
# (which you DO NOT NEED TO EXPLOIT) and the likely vulnerable points in the code.
#
# You may want to check out (https://bit.ly/3dTaUaN) and (https://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf)
# to help figure out this exploit!
